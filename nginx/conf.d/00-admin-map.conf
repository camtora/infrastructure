# Per-service authorization (admin-only access) - DISABLED
#
# The nginx map approach doesn't work because oauth2-proxy's X-Auth-Request-Email
# header is not being captured by auth_request_set. This needs investigation
# of the oauth2-proxy configuration.
#
# For now, all authenticated users have access to all protected services.
# Per-service authorization will need to be implemented differently:
# - Option 1: Fix oauth2-proxy to return X-Auth-Request-* headers
# - Option 2: Use application-level authorization in each service
# - Option 3: Use a different auth gateway that supports per-service ACLs
